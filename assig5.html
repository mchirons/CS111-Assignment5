<h1>CS 111, Summer 2015</h1>
<h1>Assignment 5</h1>
<h2 class="western">Overview</h2>
<p>For this assignment, you will complete searching/sorting tasks and
efficiency analysis. No code is to be written for this assignment.</p>
<h3 class="western">Problem</h3>
<p>Write your answers in the file assign5.txt (which you should
create). Use jEdit, TextEdit, WordPad, or some other editor that can
produce “plain text” or “plain ascii” files.</p>
<ol type="a">
	<li>
<p>Trace selection sort on the following array of letters
	(sort into alphabetical order): 
	</p>
	<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">M U E J R Q X B</pre><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
	That is, after each pass (outer loop iteration) of selection sort,
	show the contents of the array and the number of letter-to-letter
	comparisons performed on that pass (an exact number, not big-O). 
	</p>
	</li><li>
<p>Trace insertion sort on the following array of letters
	(sort into alphabetical order): 
	</p>
	<pre class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.2in">M U E J R Q X B</pre><p>
	That is, after each pass (outer loop iteration) of insertion sort,
	show the contents of the array and the number of letter-to-letter
	comparisons performed on that pass (an exact number, not big-O). 
	</p>
</li></ol>
<p>For each problems segment given below, do the following and write
your answers in assign5.txt:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Create an algorithm to solve the
	problem (describe it in English as part of your answer).</p>
	</li><li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Identify the factors that would
	influence the running time, and which can be known before the
	algorithm or code is executed. Assign names (such as <i>n</i>) to
	each factor. 
	</p>
	</li><li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Identify the operations that
	must be counted. 
	</p>
	</li><li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Count the operations performed
	by the algorithm or code. Express the count as a function of the
	factors you identified in Step 2. If the count cannot be expressed
	as a simple function of those factors, define the bounds that can be
	placed on the count: the best case (lower bound) and worst case
	(upper bound). 
	</p>
	</li><li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Determine what the Best Case
	Inputs are, and the Worst Case Inputs are. 
	</p>
	</li><li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Transform your count formula
	into big-O notation by: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Taking the efficiency with
		worst case input, 
		</p>
		</li><li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Dropping insignificant terms. 
		</p>
		</li><li>
<p>Dropping constant coefficients. 
		</p>
	</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>c. Determine if 2 arrays contain the same elements in the same
order<br>
d. Counting total number of characters that have a
duplicate within a string (i.e. "gigi the gato" would
result in 3, since g, i, and t are repeated.)<br>
e. Finding an
empty row in a 2-D array where empty is defined as a row with all
entries equal to 0.</p>
<h3 class="western">Hand in</h3>
<p>Hand in he file assig5.txt that you create with your answers, as
an attachment to this assignment in the Sakai Assignments 2 tool. 
This assignment is due at 4 <b>AM</b><span style="font-weight: normal">
on Tuesday, July 28.  Note that that is very early </span><b>Tuesday
morning</b><span style="font-weight: normal">.</span></p>
